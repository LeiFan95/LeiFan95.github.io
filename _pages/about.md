<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

**Greetings from Evanston.** 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University under the supervision of [Prof. Ying Wu](http://users.ece.northwestern.edu/~yingwu/). My research interests lies in **the intersection of computer vision and robotics**, with a particular emphasis on <ins>**active vision**</ins> (<ins>*The agent is endowed with the ability to move and perceive*</ins>).
I am constantly investigating the challenges inherent to active vision agents in an open-world context. These challenges include, but are not limited to, *continual learning*, *few-sample learning*, and *uncertainty quantification*.

Prior to my Ph.D., my researches primarily focused on the perception in autonomous driving vehicles, encompassing areas such as stereo vision, 3D mapping, moving-object detection and map repair.
